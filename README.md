# What-is-Next-Hip-Hop-Hit
## NYU DS-1001 Term Project


<p>What makes a certain hip-hop song a hit? Is there any similarity shared by these Billboard winners over time? The aim of the project is to identify the elements that make up a popular hip-hop song. More specifically, by looking at the lyrics,
performing sentiment analysis, and other analytical modelling, we would like to know if a given song would become a hit on the Billboard charts. The practical value of the project lies in the fact that entertainment industry is a typical “winners-take-all” market. Technology may seem to enable people to have access to a wider range of music options but it actually skews people’s consumption of the biggest hits and most powerful platforms. It turns out everyone wants hits — the more familiar the better, says Derek Thompson, author of a book entitled ‘Hit Makers’.[1] Determining the formula for hit songs will give musicians of this generation insights into composing and producing songs that have high business value. 
  
In this project, we used several models including Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Sentiment analysis and topic modelling were as well applied. We also explored the mechanism behind the models we tested in order to explain the accuracy level observed.</p>
